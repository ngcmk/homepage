2. **Tabs** - Content organization
3. **Dialog** - Modal interactions
4. **Separator** - Visual content division

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Week 1)
1. Install and implement Form components
2. Add Toast notifications
3. Replace mobile menu with Sheet
4. Add Progress to project initialization

### Phase 2: Visual Enhancement (Week 2)
1. Implement NavigationMenu
2. Add Badge components to services
3. Integrate Avatar in testimonials
4. Add Skeleton loading states

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
1. Add Accordion for expandable content
2. Implement Tabs for content organization
3. Add Dialog components for modals
4. Enhance with additional UI elements

## Code Examples

### Enhanced Header with NavigationMenu
```tsx
import {
  NavigationMenu,
  NavigationMenuContent,
  NavigationMenuItem,
  NavigationMenuList,
  NavigationMenuTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/navigation-menu"

// Replace current navigation with proper NavigationMenu structure
```

### Form with Validation
```tsx
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import * as z from "zod"
import {
  Form,
  FormControl,
  FormField,
  FormItem,
  FormLabel,
  FormMessage,
} from "@/components/ui/form"

// Implement proper form validation with better UX
```

- High contrast design system

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Impact
- shadcn/ui components are tree-shakeable
- Only import components that are actually used
- Minimal impact on bundle size
- Better performance than custom implementations

### Loading Performance
- Skeleton components improve perceived performance
- Proper loading states reduce user frustration
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- Implement new components alongside existing ones
- Gradual migration without breaking changes
- Feature flags for testing new components
- Rollback strategy for each component

### Testing Approach
1. Component-level testing for new implementations
2. Visual regression testing
3. Accessibility testing with screen readers
4. Mobile device testing
5. Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Reduced form abandonment rates
- Improved accessibility scores
- Better mobile usability metrics
- Faster task completion times

### Development Experience
- Reduced custom component code
- Better maintainability
- Consistent design patterns
- Faster feature development

## Conclusion

Implementing these shadcn/ui components will significantly improve the user experience while maintaining the current functionality. The modular approach allows for gradual implementation and testing, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal risk.

The focus should be on high-impact improvements first (forms, navigation, notifications) before moving to visual enhancements and advanced features.
