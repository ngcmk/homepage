## Translation Status Key:
- **Not Started**: File needs translation review
- **In Progress**: Translation work started
- **Completed**: Translations verified and complete

## Verification Process:
1. Check all displayed text uses t() function from language context
2. Verify translations exist in all 3 languages (en, mk, sr)
3. Test UI with each language to confirm proper rendering
4. Check for any hardcoded text that should be translated
